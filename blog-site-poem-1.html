        Sept-21-2015          Blaze<p></div>
        Heart in a Blaze<p>
          like a wildfire<p>
          raging through the veins<p>
          of her soul<p>
         Foggy smoke<p>
          trapped in her lungs<p>
          leaves her skin feeling frigid cold<p>
         Although her heart is burning<p>
          and her mind is racing<p>
          she’d dare let heat escape her lips<p>
          ‘cause she knows the burning sun<p>
          after a bitter night<p>
          is fire disguised as a gleaming kiss<p>
         She would rather imitate the moon<p>
          modest in essence<p>
          and glow amongst the stars<p>
         Instead of chase after dawn<p>
          and face the truth that<p>
          we never really see purpose<p>
          in who we are<p>
