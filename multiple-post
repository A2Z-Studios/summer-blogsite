          <p>Dec-22-2013 Golden Boy
              Fear of what I can see 
              A broken soul, hiding from me 
              a bruised boy, limp & angry 
              Horribly quiet, begging for peace 
              Begging to be happy 
              truly happy with no boundaries 
              All this pain keeps washing up on sea 
              Slowly drowning 
              Till you can’t even breathe 
              Saltwater on an open scar 
              How much pain will you take 
              How much hurt will you make 
              Baby you just need a little break 
              Put your blade down 
              What else can your beautiful hands create? 
              Draw your world for me 
              Paint it into my mind, so vivdly 
              Like each of the scars running down your back 
              Forgotten memories, as life begins to fall off track 
              Boiling over, as pain spins back 
              Happiness does not last long, why is that? 
              There are no monsters under your bed 
              They all exist inside your head 
              Violating your mind 
              invading your space 
              Trying to convince you that you’re already dead 
              But you aren’t 
              Your pulse beats slow 
              Your eyes light up; an occasional glow 
              A spark of the heart 
              a glimpse of happy 
              Taste the sugar 
              But don’t get too sappy 
              Created using Notebooks by Droid-Veda LLP Dec-22-2013 
              Golden boy, burned by the fire 
              Golden boy, melted into a liar 
              without my smile so bright 
              how can I bring your heart to sleep tonight 
              Without my touch so warm 
              How can I mold your heart untorn 
              Good kid, with an aching mind 
              Low eyes, barely holding on to life 
              Mind awake, in the dead of the night 
              Heart wonders, what is really right 
              It’s okay to shed some tears 
              saltwater on your open scars 
              It’s okay to let love near 
              Where did you bury your tattered heart?
              I could tell so well, 
              Even from the very start

        Bare Thoughts Freestyle<p>
          Up....like why the fuck. <p>
          My mind’s still racing, my heart still chasing.<p>
          I could be walking across the floor pacing.<p>
          Or drowning in the bathroom tub basin. *sigh*<p>
          This is what love feels like, its aching.<p>
          The feelings & fears on my chest you’re raking.<p>
          Pulling me back & forth, and I hate it.<p>
          Knocking down my brick walls, I’m so naked.<p>
          Is this a sign that we’re already wasted?<p>
          Usually I can feel in the air if Im mistaken.<p>
          But for you, I’m as blind as the one who lets life rape him.<p>
          And to you, my love will always be waiting.<p>
          So to you, there is no problem from what you’re playing.<p>
          You continue to take it.<p>
          My love,<p>
          you misuse it & abuse it.<p>
          but don’t erase it?<p>
          Maybe you should erase it...<p>
          maybe we need to just face it...<p>
          maybe our world’s too broken for us to make it...<p>
          maybe the light’s too dim for us to chase it...<p>
          sadly my thoughts are still naked.<p>
          Still ripe & bare and hardly collected enough for me to fake it...<p>

        <p>I used to call your name
            Scream it even
            Over empty turbulence that broke 
            the silence 
            of every thought in my mind
            But I swear you couldn't hear it
            I would ask you
            Beg you even
            For you to appreciate 
            the blood that spilled 
            from my heart, for you
            Thought it made me capable of breathing,
            being around you
            So when you were away 
            I'd cling to the idea of you
            Pacing the floor, 
            never once believed you'd do the things 
            i saw you do
            With proof and inevitability
            But I'd cling hard
            And hope that everything 
            would just go back to the way it was 
            supposed to be
            But that was pointless
            That was never one of our memories....
            we started this shit all wrong
            It was inevitability
            or a bittersweet
            Tranquility
            
            
            Is it wrong for me to 
            Understand your feelings but still
            I can't shake how this haunts me and taunts me
            Thinking about what went on with you two?
