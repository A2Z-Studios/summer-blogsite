    <div class="sbhd"> Author:</div> In the quiet sanctuary of her studio, Aryii wields her paintbrush not merely as an instrument of creation, but as a conduit for emotional release. Her canvases become windows to her soul, capturing the ebbs and flows of her spirit in vivid strokes and bold hues. Yet, Aryii’s artistry transcends the boundaries of the brush; it is conducted across mediums, intertwining science and self-expression into a mesmerizing work of art.<p> 
    In Aryii's art, we find a messenger, a herald of optimism, a harbinger of the extraordinary within the ordinary. Her works whisper tales of strength, reminding us that beauty exists in every crevice of existence. Aryii’s artistry is not confined to galleries; it is etched into the walls of lives, the homes of souls, and the hearts of those who glimpse the world anew through her eyes. A powerful tale of science and emotion, Aryii’s artistry is a reminder that within every brushstroke and sculpture lies the power to bridge gaps, ignite passions, and ignite the flames of curiosity. As we stand before her creations, we become witnesses to the masterpiece of her soul, where the canvas of possibility stretches infinitely beyond the horizon.<p>

        I used to call your name<p>

        Fear of what I can see<p>

        a bruised boy, limp & angry<p>
        Horribly quiet, begging for peace...<p>

          I'm afraid that I won’t be able to forget<p>
          That months will go by and you’ll still circulate in my blood<p>
          And stream out into every slit in my wrists<p>

          Memories laced in my pillowcase<p>
          Seeping out, attempting to escape<p>
          Bottled down with skin torn lies<p>
          left alone in a 10ft tall ceramic vase...<p>

          It all seemed so real<p>
          Painting my mind with facades of happy<p>
          hoping that’s all I would feel<p>

        Up....like why the fuck. My mind’s still racing, my heart still chasing. I could be walking across the floor pacing. Or drowning in the bathroom tub basin. *sigh* This is what love feels like, its aching. The feelings & fears on my chest you’re raking. Pulling me back & forth, and I hate it...
