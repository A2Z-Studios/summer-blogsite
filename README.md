Not looking for contributions but comments welcome. Using this as an archive for my personal work, possibly to go live as a ***working*** blogsite in the future and mostly just to provide adequate practice for a novice coder. If you have any input on coding practices and common mistakes that beginner programmers make--please feel free to enlighten me! I love learning new tips/tricks! xoxo
