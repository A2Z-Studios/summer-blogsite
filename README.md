# Udacity Blogsite Project
This repo serves as the hub for my Udacity blogsite project. I am also using these files for _ongoing_ archival storage of my literary pieces poems etc as an artist.

## To the Udacity REVIEWER:
+ I put different borders around all size screens to help see the difference

+ I tried to apply headers `h1` and `h2` but it caused an error code due to being nested in `<p>` so I applied the header features myself using [some help](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_hn.asp). I hope this is okay!

+ The link "Keep Reading" on the first "Spilled Ink Entry 1" contains the full blog post page. The link "Home" returns back to the index page. 

## Major Features to Add:
- Slideshow Gallery Sidebar & Page
+ Hover Entry Posts
+ Javascript Store
+ "Word of the Week" game
+ more to add

Not looking for contributions but comments welcome. Using this as an archive for my personal work, possibly to go live as a ***working*** blogsite in the future and mostly just to provide adequate practice for a novice coder. If you have any input on coding practices and common mistakes that beginner programmers make--please feel free to enlighten me! I love learning new tips/tricks! xoxo
